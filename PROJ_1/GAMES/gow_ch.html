        <h2> >>> STORY SUMMARY </h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">" Kratos mission to full fill the gods needs then the god free him from his
          nightmare "</p>


        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Set halfway through Kratos' ten years servitude to the
          Gods, Chains of Olympus begins with Kratos being dispatched to the City of Attica to help defend it from the
          invading Persian army. Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a Basilisk climbing over the city walls and
          gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the
          King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the Basilisk and kills it. After defeating the Basilisk,
          he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on
          the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the City of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of
          Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness.
          Eventually, Kratos makes his way to the Temple of Helios, the source of the remaining light, and the Sun
          Chariot. He encounters a statue of Athena, who tells him that Helios has disappeared and Morpheus has used
          this to his advantage to cause the gods to fall into a deep slumber. Athena wants Kratos to retrieve Helios so
          he can release Morpheus' grasp on the other Gods and his power over the Earth. Along the way, Kratos is
          haunted by a strange melody, which he later recognizes as a song played by his daughter, Calliope. Making his
          way through the Temple of Helios, Kratos encounters Helios' sister, Eos, who promptly sends him to the caves
          within the Temple of Olympus.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * She guarantees Kratos that the Gods will relieve him of his
          nightmares if he agrees to save Helios from the Titan Atlas, who abducted him. Casting her promise aside, as
          the Gods betrayed him before, Kratos nevertheless agrees, albeit reluctantly, to save Helios. Kratos then
          retrieves the Primordial Fire needed to awaken the Fire Steeds from the cave and returns to the temple.
          After restoring the Fire Steeds back to life, the horses lead Kratos into the Underworld before retreating.
          There, he meets Charon, on his ferry, upon the River Styx. The ferryman soon lists the similarities between
          himself and Kratos, saying they are both slaves to the Olympians. Charon then tells Kratos to go, saying it is
          not yet his time. Having denied Kratos passage, and Kratos refusing to leave, they engage in a fight, before
          Charon knocks Kratos unconscious and drops him into Tartarus. There, Kratos witnesses the breaking of the
          chains binding Atlas to the pits of Tartarus. After some time, the Spartan fights and climbs his way out of
          Tartarus, returning to defeat Charon. Seizing control of the ferry, he follows the Light of Helios, currently
          illuminating the underworld, down the River Styx, coming upon the Temple of Persephone. To his own surprise,
          he sees his daughter Calliope on the shorelines of the temple and follows her inside. Unable to locate her,
          instead he meets Persephone, Queen of the Underworld.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Persephone tells Kratos that Calliope is in the Elysium
          Fields and that the only way to see her again is for Kratos to "release" all of his past evils and become
          worthy of Elysium, giving up his powers given to him by the Gods; however, Persephone warns him that the world
          will suffer for his choice. After transferring his power into the Forsaken Tree, which included all of his
          weapons, his magic, and relics, Kratos regains his humanity, becoming a normal man and being reunited with his
          daughter. However, Persephone appears: she taunts and mocks Kratos' choice and reveals to him her true plans.
          Bitter at being betrayed by Zeus, tricked by Hades and abandoned by the Gods, Persephone was the one who had
          freed Atlas. While Kratos was disarming himself, Atlas was slowly carrying out Persephone's plan to destroy
          the Pillar of the World that holds the world, and with it, Olympus. Persephone plans to kill everyone,
          including herself, to free her from her situation. Kratos realizes now that if he stays with his daughter, it
          would mean the end of the world for everyone, including Calliope and himself. Though it tears him apart, he
          sacrifices seeing his daughter again in order to regain his power by killing all the souls in Elysium. From
          some of the souls, he gets back his weapons, relics, and magic. Because of this, he once more becomes the
          "Ghost of Sparta", regaining his characteristic appearance. After which, Calliope breaks down crying at the
          sight of a reborn Kratos, who presses on.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * With his skills restored, Kratos pursues Persephone,
          catching her at the base of the Pillar. She tells him it is the end, then reveals her other form - a winged
          woman wearing black armor - before carrying Kratos to the top of the Pillar. Once they reach the summit,
          Kratos and Persephone engage in a bloody final battle; during the battle, Persephone tries to subdue and
          confuse Kratos, urging him to go back to Elysium and be with Calliope, and when he resists, she orders Atlas
          to destroy him. Kratos chains Atlas to the roof of the Underworld before returning to battle Persephone and
          eventually killing her with the Gauntlet of Zeus. Dying, but uncaring of her fate, the Goddess taunts Kratos,
          snarling that now his suffering shall never end as her body then explodes, severing the Pillar of the World in
          the shockwave with Atlas now the only thing holding the Greek World together. Though the Titan to gloats to
          him about the God's true plans for him, Kratos believes his path is clear, serving them regardless so they
          will keep their promises to free him from his nightmares as it is all he has left. Atlas ends by foretelling
          that they will meet again.
          Keeping his own promise to the Gods, Kratos returns Helios to the sky. But he is left with the knowledge that
          his sins have consumed him, forsaking his daughter as his destiny was not to be with her. Weak from battle,
          Kratos falls unconscious from the sun chariot but is suddenly stopped before striking the ground, being placed
          on the cliffs that he would later jump from in the original God of War. Two Gods, Athena and Helios approach
          him and, as they praise him for his work, remove the Sun Shield and the Gauntlet of Zeus. As they depart
          through the Portal to Olympus, Helios suggests on helping the warrior further, only for Athena to refuse by
          saying "He'll live. They must." The pair then retreats through the gateway to Olympus, leaving an unconscious
          Kratos at the cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea.</p>
