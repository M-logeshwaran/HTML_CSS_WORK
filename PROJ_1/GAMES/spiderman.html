                <h2> >>> STORY SUMMARY </h2>
                <p style="font-size: larger;">" Peter Parker is a 23-year-old college graduate who has held the secret
                    identity of Spider-Man for eight years and has settled into his role as protector of New York
                    City.[6] In addition, he is working at a laboratory as a research assistant. After recently
                    defeating criminal Wilson Fisk, Peter must now investigate as a new gang known as the Inner Demons
                    emerges taking over Fisk's territory. "
                </p>


                <br>
                <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * During the start of the game, Peter
                    Parker/Spider-Man is in his apartment when the police radio goes off. Peter puts on his Spider-Man
                    suit and swings to the location of the crime happening. It ends up being a crime set up by Wilson
                    Fisk/the Kingpin. Spider-Man then gets a call from Yuri Watanabe and she tells him about the
                    investigation happening at Fisk Tower. Spider-Man progresses through the tower, and taking out some
                    Fisk thugs ambushing the police along Times Square, but it turns out that it was a trap and Fisk
                    attempts to escape with a helicopter but had to wait for it to land on the tower. After Spider-Man
                    breaks into the room Wilson is in, Wilson attempts to fight the Web Head. Spider-Man, luckily,
                    defeats Wilson Fisk and assists the NYPD in his arrest.

                    After the Kingpin of Crime's arrest, the authorities finally had enough evidence to serve a warrant.
                    Afterwards, Peter investigates a possible break-in at an auction house storing Fisk's art
                    collection, where he runs into his ex-girlfriend Mary Jane Watson as well as masked gunmen searching
                    for a file. Mary Jane finds the file, which details a secret project named "Devil's Breath", but the
                    gunmen seize the file from her and escape. Despite being estranged, Peter and Mary Jane decide to
                    work together to investigate the theft. Peter consults with Martin Li about the origin of the masks,
                    and Li remarks they are involved with a group called the "Inner Demons" and warns Peter not to
                    investigate further. Peter, who helps Dr. Otto Octavius in his lab, returns to finish work on their
                    artificial arm, but Mayor Norman Osborn forcibly shuts down the lab, seizes Octavius' research, and
                    terminates his grant.</p>



                <br>
                <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Meanwhile, the Inner Demons continue to attack
                    Fisk's properties and holdings. After several victories against them with the help of Officer
                    Jefferson Davis, Peter attends a rally for Osborn's re-election campaign with Davis, Mary Jane,
                    Miles Morales, and Rio Morales also in attendance. However, Mayor Osborn receives an anonymous
                    threat, promising to destroy him and his city, causing him to leave the rally early. The Inner
                    Demons then attack the rally with suicide bombers, killing many of the attendees including Davis,
                    who is Miles' father. Peter witnesses Li, taking the alternate form of "Mr. Negative", leading the
                    attack on the rally. He tries to save MJ. However, he is knocked out by the blast.

                    In the aftermath of the attack, Miles joins F.E.A.S.T. as a volunteer, meets Peter, and quickly
                    befriends him. At the same time, Osborn hires mercenary Silver Sable and her private military
                    company, Sable International, to take down the Inner Demons. Sable doesn't trust Peter and
                    constantly makes things difficult for him. Peter continues to pursue Mister Negative and the Inner
                    Demons, discovering that Li has a grudge against Osborn and seeks to steal the Devil's Breath, a
                    bioweapon Osborn inadvertently created while searching for a universal cure for disease. </p>



                <br>
                <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Li manages to steal the Devil's Breath and attempts
                    to deploy it in Grand Central Station, but is foiled by the efforts of both Peter and Mary Jane. He
                    is subsequently arrested and sent to the Raft, a high-security prison. Meanwhile, Octavius becomes
                    more obsessed with getting revenge on Osborn and begins further developing his artificial arms,
                    turning them into large tentacle-like constructs and controlling them via an untested neural
                    implant. Peter quickly grows concerned that the implant may negatively affect Octavius' mental
                    state.

                    With his new arms, Octavius attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft as "Doctor Octopus", releasing
                    all of the prisoners within including Mister Negative, Electro, the Vulture, the Rhino, and the
                    Scorpion, with whom he forms the Sinister Six. He also steals the Devil's Breath from police custody
                    and releases it in Times Square, infecting hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, including Peter's
                    Aunt May. With the combination of the outbreak and the mass escape of criminals, New York quickly
                    falls into chaos, and Osborn declares martial law. Peter goes to apprehend his escaped enemies,
                    quickly rounding up Electro, Vulture, Rhino, and Scorpion while Mary Jane searches for the Devil's
                    Breath cure Oscorp is seemingly working on. She breaks into Osborn's penthouse and learns that his
                    son Harry – Peter and Mary Jane's best friend – is terminally ill and that the Devil's Breath was
                    actually designed as a cure for his condition.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * After discovering his secret lab, Mary Jane learns
                    that Martin Li was one of the test subjects for the Devil's Breath which granted him his powers.
                    This, however, ended in tragedy as Li had accidentally killed his parents, sparking his grudge
                    against Osborn. Mary Jane soon learns the location of the cure and informs Peter. After convincing
                    Sable that he's trustworthy, Peter heads to the lab and defeats Li, but Octavius arrives and takes
                    both Osborn and the cure, leaving Peter critically wounded.

                    With no other choice, Peter builds himself a new armored suit and goes after Doctor Octopus, who
                    reveals he knew Peter was Spider-Man, defeating him atop Oscorp Tower while saving both Osborn and
                    the cure. The amount of cure recovered, however, is too small to save everyone infected and Peter is
                    faced with the choice of either using the limited amount to save Aunt May, who is on the verge of
                    death, or allowing the doctors to study it and mass-produce a cure to save everyone else. Peter
                    ultimately chooses the latter and has a tearful farewell with Aunt May, who reveals she already
                    knows he is Spider-Man before passing away.</p>


                <br>
                <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Silver Sable leaves New York to rethink her life
                    choices following her encounter with Peter. Meanwhile, Miles is bitten by a spider that escaped
                    Osborn's personal lab via being on MJ's shoulder the whole time. A funeral is held for Aunt May, who
                    is buried next to Uncle Ben. Three months later, New York has largely returned to normal and Peter
                    and Mary Jane decide to rekindle their relationship.

                    In a mid-credits scene, Miles reveals to Peter that he has gained spider-like powers, prompting
                    Peter to reveal that he is Spider-Man. In a post-credits scene, Osborn, who has resigned as mayor in
                    disgrace, returns to his lab where he has Harry kept in a holding tank with a black web-like
                    substance until a cure can be found for his condition. As Osborn places his hand on the tank, the
                    substance reacts and copies him.</p>
