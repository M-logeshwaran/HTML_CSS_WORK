        <h2> >>> STORY SUMMARY </h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">" By defeating Ares, Kratos, the once mortal warrior, became the new God of War.
          However, Kratos soon found himself alone on Olympus, shunned by his fellow Gods. "</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God
          of War: Ghost of Sparta, but over 13 years after the events of God of War; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has
          become the new God of War, but unfortunately, he has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless
          treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while
          working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan Army in
          conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from
          the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a God. Kratos
          replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan Army.
          Kratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices
          an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing it
          into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos.
          After a protracted conflict with the giant golden statue that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the
          Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus'
          behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the
          Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the
          severed, falling hand of the Statue.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Kratos realizes he must retrieve the Blade of Olympus to
          save himself. As he slowly gets up and limps his way to the sword, Zeus reveals himself as the Eagle that
          stole his powers, and he betrayed Kratos so that his fate will not be the same as Ares'. Zeus demands that he
          surrender but when Kratos refuses, Zeus stabs the Blade of Olympus into Kratos' stomach, killing him after he
          refuses to forever serve the Gods and wiping out all the Spartans & Rhodian soldiers.
          However, as Kratos is being dragged towards an eternity of torment in the Underworld, he is saved by Gaia, the
          mother of the Titans and the franchise's narrator, who offers an alliance. Kratos, who still has some little
          remaining power in him, escapes the Underworld and is bidden by Gaia to find the Sisters of Fate in order to
          change his past, regain back his godly powers as well as his status as the "God of War," and then avert his
          betrayal and kill Zeus. She then gives Kratos the aid of the magical horse Pegasus to traverse the distance to
          the Sisters.
          Kratos and Pegasus, after a detour to a mountain that houses the Titan Typhon and the former Titan Prometheus,
          start flying towards the Island of Creation, but are again attacked by Griffins and Ravens, aided by the Dark
          Rider. The Dark Rider succeeds in slamming into Pegasus, sending the horse plummeting to its death, but Kratos
          counter-attacks by jumping onto The Dark Griffin, killing the Dark Rider with the Spear of Destiny, and
          killing the Dark Griffin by lodging the Spear in its neck, as Kratos dives to the Island of Creation below.
        </p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * As he explores the Island, Kratos questions why Gaia offers
          to help him. Gaia then tells the story of Zeus and how Cronos, Zeus' father, ate all of his children to
          prevent the prophecy that one of his own children would rise against him and how Rhea, Zeus' mother, saved her
          child and sent him away to an island that was really Gaia, the Titaness Mother of Earth and Zeus' grandmother,
          and Gaia nurtured Zeus until he grew to be a man and sought revenge against Cronos and all the Titans. Kratos
          then encounters the likes of his cousin and a demigod, Theseus, who he kills and from whom gains the Horse
          Keeper's Key and the Steeds of Time (a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own
          fate), Perseus, Kratos' half-brother and a demigod, who he savagely kills and takes his reflective shield to
          progress, the Captain from the ship in the beginning of the God of War, and the Barbarian King whom he
          decapitated in the original God of War, from whom he takes the Barbarian Hammer. Kratos also encounters a
          haggard and crazed Icarus, from whom he takes his wings, and the Gorgon Queen Euryale, from whom he gains the
          Head of Euryale by decapitating.
          Kratos lands upon the Titan Atlas below the Earth and tries to communicate with him. At first, Atlas resents
          the sight of the Spartan and refuses to help Kratos, bent on crushing the human for his new imprisonment since
          their last meeting in God of War: Chains of Olympus. However, Kratos manages to persuade Atlas to help him so
          that he may change his fate and kill Zeus. Atlas, intrigued by Kratos' goal, he tells him about the Blade of
          Olympus' creation: As the Great War between the Gods and the Titans emerged, Zeus soon created a powerful
          weapon called the Blade of Olympus to end the Great War and with the Blade he banished the Titans to the
          depths of Tartarus. When the Titans were defeated by the Gods, they were punished and humiliated, and they
          want Kratos' help to exact revenge. With the Titan accepting the offer, he grants Kratos a new power called
          the Atlas Quake and helps him back to the surface so that he may continue his quest. After reaching the
          surface, he kills the Kraken and reawakens the Phoenix to fly towards the Temple of Fates with his desire for
          revenge for Zeus and a knowledge gained from one of his fellow soldiers on how Zeus destroyed Sparta as an act
          of anger that helps him continue his quest. Finally reaching the Throne Room, Kratos expresses his firm desire
          to change his own fate, and that of Zeus, the King of the Gods of Olympus, after which the Sisters deny him
          passage through. Kratos then confronts Lahkesis.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * After a gruesome battle, Kratos stands witness as the
          middle sister Atropos comes forth from within the defeated Lahkesis, taking Kratos back in time, to the very
          moment of his battle with Ares. Planning on cutting his life short by destroying the Blade of the Gods, Kratos
          interferes by defending the Blade of the Gods, thus keeping the way things originally were. He soon defeats
          Atropos before traveling back to the present time while leaving Atropos trapped in a mirror. Now fighting both
          Lahkesis and Atropos at the same time, Kratos manages to stab the two Sisters with his blades and destroy the
          mirror they are trapped in. Thus, imprisoning both sisters for good.
          Kratos then makes his way to the remaining sister, Clotho, who operates and defends the Loom of Fate, which
          rules the lives of mortals and Gods alike. Pinning Clotho's hands to the ground, Kratos manages to impale her
          skull with a giant swinging blade-like pendulum, killing her. With the defeat of the three Sisters of Fates,
          Kratos granted himself control over the Loom and his own destiny. Kratos, finally having his powers back and
          becoming the God of War once again, goes back to his death at Zeus' hands in Rhodes, saving his past self and
          reclaiming the Blade of Olympus from a surprised Zeus, inciting a lengthy battle with the King of the Gods. At
          the end of the fight, Zeus stuns Kratos with a powerful lighting storm, Kratos then announces untruthfully
          that he surrenders. As Zeus is about to kill Kratos, who then deflects the blow using an energy blast and pins
          Zeus' hands to the rock with the Blades of Athena. Kratos then takes the Blade of Olympus and begins driving
          it into Zeus' chest exactly how Zeus stabbed him with.
          Before he could finish, Athena arrives and defends Zeus, however, Kratos is angered by her betrayal and
          interference as Athena announces her intentions to protect Olympus. The badly wounded Zeus attempts to escape,
          while stating Kratos has started a war, he can't possibly win as the Sisters of Fate already predicted his
          victory. </p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * However, Kratos breaks free of the defending Athena,
          charging towards Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the
          Blade, granting Zeus escape. A stunned Kratos asks her why she did this as the dying Goddess reveals that
          Zeus' actions are meant to break the Cycle of Patricide as an another new son starts killing his father, which
          goes back to Cronos killing Uranus, and Zeus killing Cronos. Before he can kill him, Zeus had hoped to break
          the cycle - thus confirming that Kratos is, in fact, Zeus' own son, which reveals that Kratos is a demigod
          right before he became fully a God after slaughtering Ares, and she begs him to relent in his quest for
          vengeance.
          After a moment of apparent shock and shame, Kratos darkens and snarls that he has no father. Athena dies in
          Kratos' arms, saying that all the Gods on Olympus will deny Kratos, defending Zeus so Olympus will prevail.
          She said that even though Kratos wishes to kill Zeus, Zeus is Olympus. Kratos then vows to exact retribution
          on Zeus and any God who will deny him his vengeance, saying that their time is at an end. The dead Athena's
          body soon explodes as Gaia speaks to Kratos and reminds him that he has the power to control time itself.
          Kratos returns to the Loom, as the room its in collapses around him and he goes back in time once more to the
          Great War of the Gods and Titans. He calls to Gaia and she announces that the Titans were expecting him and
          then Kratos explains they can win the Great War in his time.
          As a defeated Zeus encourages his fellow Gods to help him kill the now rogue Kratos, every single Titan to
          ever exist returns to Kratos' time in their prime forms (due to Kratos going back in time to when all of the
          Titan were at their strongest to give Kratos his best chance of winning), angry and vengeful they climb Mount
          Olympus to kill Zeus and the Gods.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger;text-align: center;"> * Leading them, Kratos announces to Zeus "Zeus! Your son has
          returned, I bring the destruction of Olympus!!!", thus leading directly into the events of God of War III</p>
