        <h2> >>> STORY SUMMARY </h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">" Many years have passed since Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian
          Gods. Having survived his final encounter with his father Zeus, Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in
          Ancient Scandenavia and now lives with his young son Atreus in the land of the Norse Gods, a savage land
          inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors. In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos' second
          wife) has recently died, how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for
          many years and embrace his newfound role as a father and mentor. "</p>


        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Many years have passed since Kratos, a Spartan warrior and
          former Greek God of War, took his vengeance against the Greek Gods, and he now lives with his young son Atreus
          in Ancient Norway in the Realm of Midgard. The game begins after the death of the Jötunn warrior Faye, Kratos'
          second wife and Atreus' mother, whose last request was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the
          Nine Realms. Kratos and Atreus prepare a funeral pyre for her, mourn her death and soon go on a hunt as per
          Kratos' desire. However much to Kratos' disappointment, Atreus proves his incompetence and lack of focus,
          making Kratos reconsider taking Atreus in his journey. Kratos is soon attacked by a mysterious stranger with
          godlike powers, and who cannot feel anything physically. After seemingly killing him, Kratos reluctantly takes
          Atreus with him and begins their journey.
          Kratos and Atreus soon encounter many hurdles in their journey and fend them off. They also meet the Dwarven
          Huldra brothers, Brok and Sindri who upgrade their weaponry throughout their journey, and a mysterious but
          friendly Witch of the Woods, who also provides help in her own way after they save her boar, which Atreus
          accidentally shot. Reaching the Lake of Nine, Kratos and Atreus encounter the friendly World Serpent,
          Jörmungandr, the last remaining Giant. After running into impenetrable black mist which can only be
          extinguished with the Light of Alfheim, they receive aid from the Witch to use the Bifröst in order to travel
          to Alfheim and secure the Light. Upon vanquishing the mist and reaching Midgard's peak, Kratos and Atreus find
          out the Stranger who attacked them is alive and has two henchmen, the sons of Thor, Magni and Modi at his
          side, interrogating an imprisoned man, revealed to be Mimir.</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Atreus is cured, and Kratos tells him he is a God. Atreus
          then becomes increasingly arrogant on their journey, and he murders a weakened Modi, despite Kratos ordering
          him not to. At Midgard's peak, they are ambushed by Baldur. Atreus foolishly picks a fight with Baldur, who
          then proceeds to destroy the Portal to Jötunheim and throw the group into Helheim.
          Atreus is reprimanded by Kratos and makes amends with him, and while escaping from Helheim, they discover
          Baldur is Freya's son. Desperate to protect him, Freya had cast a spell on Baldur that made him immune to all
          physical and magical threats, but also made him unable to feel any joys of life, causing Baldur to resent his
          mother. Kratos and Atreus also discover that Mimir had been bewitched by Freya to not reveal the spell’s
          weakness, mistletoe. Returning to Midgard, Mímir realizes there is another way to reach Jötunheim, but he
          needs his missing eye. After obtaining it from the inside of Jörmungandr, who inadvertently swallowed it when
          he ate Thor's Statue, they are attacked by Baldur again, but Freya intervenes in an attempt to protect her
          son. During the fight, Baldur is pierced by Atreus' mistletoe arrow, breaking Freya's spell. </p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * After an enormous battle, Baldur is defeated, and despite
          being given an opportunity to retreat, he attempts to strangle Freya, forcing Kratos to kill him. A grieving
          Freya swears revenge and taunts Kratos about hiding his true nature. Kratos finally tells Atreus about his
          past and how he had killed his fellow Greek Gods, including his father Zeus. Atreus laments and Kratos tells
          him that they should learn from their experiences and not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. Freya
          leaves with Baldur's corpse in silence, and Mímir hopefully suggests that she will eventually move on and
          accept that Kratos did the right thing.
          After finally arriving in Jötunheim, they find a Temple with a mural depicting their adventures, showing the
          Giants had foreseen everything that would happen and vaguely foretold what was to come. In addition, they
          discover Faye was a Giant who decided to stay behind in Midgard, making Atreus part God, Giant, and Mortal
          (due to Kratos being a former demigod before becoming a full God after killing Ares who was the original God
          of War).</p>



        <br>
        <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"> * Their fight with Baldur was shown, revealing he was after
          Faye the whole time, unaware she was deceased. It is also revealed that Atreus was named Loki by his mother.
          Kratos and Atreus then fulfill their promise and spread her ashes at the peak, overlooking a valley of Giants
          corpses. Afterwards, Kratos reveals to Atreus that his given name was that of a compassionate Spartan Comrade.
          Returning to Midgard, Mímir warns them that the three-year long Fimbulwinter began, meaning Ragnarök is soon
          to follow—which was not supposed to occur for another hundred years, he also tells them that Freya found him
          and interrogated him about the whereabouts of her Valkyrie wings, saying that the cycle of vengeance is not
          easily broken and implying that she was following through on her plan to get revenge on Kratos.
          In the game's secret ending, Kratos and Atreus return home and slumber. Atreus has a vision that Thor will
          arrive at the end of Fimbulwinter to confront them.</p>
